### Description

A new Boxxi game. Select groups of blocks to remove. Based loosely on a game I downloaded on Planet several years ago. The person's name was Dvadi I think. This version uses his blocks, but all of the programming is new and completely commented. This code demonstrates the use of arrays of UDA's, and is just a lot of fun to play. The high score is stored in an ASCII text file in the program directory (no messing with the registry!!!) If you like it, please vote.
